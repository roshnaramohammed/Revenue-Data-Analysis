### Domain:  Hospitality        
### Function: Revenue
## Problem 
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.


## Task 

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

 
## Procedure
1. **Collecting Data**:Gather relevant datasets from various sources, ensuring they contain the necessary information for your analysis.
2. **Cleaning Dataset using Power Query Editor**:Utilize the Power Query Editor to clean and transform the collected datasets. This involves handling missing data, removing duplicates, and structuring the data for analysis.
3. **Building Metrics using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**:Define and calculate key performance metrics using DAX, a formula language used in Power BI. This step involves creating measures and calculated columns to derive meaningful insights from the data.
4. **Creating Data Model**:Develop a robust data model using Power BI. This involves establishing relationships between tables, optimizing the structure for performance, and ensuring that the model accurately represents the business logic.
5. **Creating Dashboard**:Design and create an interactive dashboard in Power BI, utilizing the data model and visualizations. Customize the dashboard to present key insights and allow users to interact with the data dynamically.
